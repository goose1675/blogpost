//service classes are different from models because they contain the business logic of the application.
// They are responsible for processing data, interacting with repositories, and implementing the application's core functionality.
// on the other hand, models represent the data structure and relationships in the application.
//for example, a UserService class would handle operations like adding, updating, or deleting users,
// while a User model would define the properties of a user, such as username and password.
